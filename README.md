# TSP Solver Comparison

This repository aims to compare different solvers for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using benchmark instances from TSPLIB, a well-known online database of TSP benchmark instances.

## Overview

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

This project will evaluate and compare different TSP solvers that can be called from Python:
- [Google OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools)
- [python_tsp library](https://github.com/fillipe-gsm/python-tsp)
- Other potential solvers

## Goals

- Benchmark various TSP solvers against TSPLIB instances
- Compare solution quality and computation time
- Provide insights on which solver works best for different problem sizes and characteristics


## Data

The benchmarks use instances from [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/), a library of sample instances for the TSP maintained by the University of Heidelberg.

## Results

Results and analysis will be added as the project progresses.
